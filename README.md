# CPPND: Capstone Snake Game Example

This is a repo for the Capstone project in the [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213). The code for this repo was inspired by [this](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/212296/snake-game-in-c-with-sdl) excellent StackOverflow post and set of responses.

## Changes to the original project

1. A different way of spawning food
   1. Now there could be at most 5 food at the same time.
   2. If all food is consumed by snake, then one food would be immediately spawned.
   3. If the number of food is less than 5, then spawn a food when it's 5 seconds from the last time.

2. Added a Timer class
   1. The Timer uses multi thread to count time lapses.
   2. It supports several manipulative methods like Start, Stop.

3. Add 2 new types of food
   1. Snake could gain more scores from eating a Enhanced or Super food.
   2. Also, these two types of food are rendered in different colors.
